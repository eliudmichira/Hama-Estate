## 💰 **THE PAYMENT REVOLUTION - M-Pesa Integration**

### **🔥 One-Click Payment Flow:**

1. **Tenant clicks "PAY RENT NOW"**

3. **Tenant enters M-Pesa PIN** on their phone
4. **Payment confirmed instantly**
5. **Both dashboards update automatically**
6. **Receipts sent via SMS & email**
7. **Credit score updated (+25 points)**

### **🚀 Technical Implementation:**

#### **Frontend Integration:**
```javascript
// Real M-Pesa STK Push
const paymentData = {
  phoneNumber: mpesaAPI.formatPhone(tenantData.phone),
  amount: tenantData.monthlyRent,
  accountReference: `RENT-${tenantId}`,
  transactionDesc: `Rent payment for ${propertyName}`
};

const response = await mpesaAPI.initiate(paymentData);
```

#### **Backend Firebase Functions:**
```javascript
// M-Pesa STK Push Integration
exports.initiateMpesaPayment = functions.https.onCall(async (data) => {
  // Validate and format phone number
  // Generate M-Pesa credentials
  // Send STK Push request
  // Return checkout request ID
});

exports.mpesaCallback = functions.https.onRequest(async (req, res) => {
  // Process M-Pesa callback
